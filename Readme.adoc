Variety of Templates::

Compatibility:: 
Fully compatible with adoc Studio on both Mac and iPad.

AsciiDoc Markup:: 
Leverages the powerful AsciiDoc syntax for clear and structured documentation.

== Purpose

This repository contains a collection of the latest templates for {app-name}.

AsciiDoc is an extreme powerful markup language designed for more complex content. 
It uses a more extensive syntax than Markdown, allowing you to create more advanced formatting elements such as tables, footnotes, and cross-references. 
All without the headaches of inconsistent implementations frequently found with Markdown. 
For writing high-quality documentation, it just works.

Furthermore AsciiDoc is simply plain-text.
You can author documents in {app-url}[{app-name}] or any other text editor of choice, such as Visual Studio Code with a proper extension, or any derivative of VIM.


If you're just getting started with AsciiDoc, you may watch the video below, or any other one on https://www.youtube.com/@adocStudio/videos[YouTube].
