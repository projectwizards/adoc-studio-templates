== Foreword

Note the spelling of “Foreword”, which is different from the spelling of the more commonly used “forward”. The Foreword is a short section written by someone other than the author that summarizes or sets up the theme of the book. The person who writes the Foreword is often an eminent colleague or associate, a professional who has had personal interaction with the author. “Foreword by [person of note]” is often included on the cover, as it is a tacit endorsement and helps readers identify the book’s theme or genre. The Foreword is more common in nonfiction.
