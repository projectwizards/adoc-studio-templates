Writing a book these days inevitably means offering readers an electronic version.

Over the last few years, I've tried most typesetting systems, up to and including AsciiDoc, which I finally settled on to standardise my documents. This is also how adoc Studio came about, but you can read about it https://www.adoc-studio.app/blog/making-of-adoc-studio[here].

As it turns out, I'm not the only one, as many large book publishers use AsciiDoc to create their titles.

This template provides an easy starting point to write a book in adoc Studio.
