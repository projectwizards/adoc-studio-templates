== Epilogue

Not all book series get happily-ever-after endings. When your book series ends but you want a way to let the readers know what’s in store for the characters’ futures, an epilogue is a strong way to do that.

What is an epilogue?

An epilogue is a short chapter that comes after the last chapter of a book as a way to tie the story together in a conclusion.

Essentially, the epilogue is the answer to the question, “What happens to them next?” This serves as a more satisfying way to let readers know that characters live “happily ever after.”

Sometimes the ending of the story isn’t satisfying enough for readers.

That part of their story may end, but if your readers want a more in-depth look at their life “after” the story, that’s when an epilogue would come into play to tie everything together.
