== Acknowledgments

Acknowledgments are a public thank you for the support and contributions of individuals who were involved in the project. The author has leeway with this sectionâ€™s placement as well. Acknowledgements can be in the Front Matter, usually here e before the Introduction, or may be placed in the Back Matter. If it feels more natural for you to thank people prior to a special event or after one, and whether said thanks might give something away about your story or content, should determine where you place your Acknowledgements.
